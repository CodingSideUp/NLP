However, failing to look at the side effects for Provigil could end up costing you your life. Provigil of course does list the usual side effects, yes, but ther is one side effect listed that is rarely included as a medication side effect.

The side effect is called \"vasodilatation\", and the manufacturer reported to the FDA that it occurred to 1 out of every 50 test subjects while it happened to 0 out of every 50 who took the placebo. What is \"vasodilatation\"?  Vasodilatation, nearly always referred to as the more recognizable \"vasodilation\", refers to the general relaxation of blood vessels, a phenomenon that usually ends up causing a small drop in blood pressure but sometimes causes a significant blood pressure drop, when it is then called hypotension.

Since you have to be able to clearly and honestly assess your emotions and thoughts, determining how much medication you need is tough.

My boobs no longer fit into my bras, even some shirts. It was like they doubled in size overnight (not a huge problem, just annoying with no explanation). I went out and bought a bra, a week later it didn't even cover my boobs. Lastly, I've been fretting the last 2 weeks because I still haven't gotten my period! I never had a problem with my periods showing up in the past, they've always been lighter and not very long, pretty ideal actually. The Dr. said I would bleed between... still not bleeding! I've taken 3 pregnancy tests, wasted 10 bucks on each! Oh yeah, I've been crying for no reason at all the last month. I started crying over some lady I didn't even know at work. I do not recommend taking Seasonique. I know it must be expensive although I don't know how much because my Dr. gave me sample packs and I'm not going to bother refilling it. Also they give you a coupon for $50 off and $25 off the next refill, if they are giving that much off it must be a lot. It wasn't terrible, just nothing was expected (and I still have no clue as to why I haven't gotten a period yet). I've tried several other birth control pills and never had any side effects with any of them. This is the first time I tried one where I only get a period every three months so maybe those are way different or something. If you are looking for a good pill, Yaz worked great for me and I never had any breakthrough bleeding, mood swings, loss of sex drive, acne or anything. Hope this helps.\",\n",

Such side effects are so common that virtually every new prescription medication ends up listing them, which is why most of us don\\'t bother reading the side effect profile for meds. However, failing to look at the side effects for Provigil could end up costing you your life. Provigil of course does list the usual side effects, yes, but ther is one side effect listed that is rarely included as a medication side effect.  Further, even if you should happen to actually read the list of Provigil\\'s side you are not likely to know what it means. The side effect is called \"vasodilatation\", and the manufacturer reported to the FDA that it occurred to 1 out of every 50 test subjects while it happened to 0 out of every 50 who took the placebo. What is \"vasodilatation\"?  Vasodilatation, nearly always referred to as the more recognizable \"vasodilation\", refers to the general relaxation of blood vessels, a phenomenon that usually ends up causing a small drop in blood pressure but sometimes causes a significant blood pressure drop, when it is then called hypotension.  And, if you\\'ll read on, you\\'ll see why for me, and potentially for 1 out of every 50 users of Provigil, it very nearly killed me.  \\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nAfter 7 weeks on Provigil, with the last week having been increased from 200mg to 300mg per day, I awoke one morning in a highly delusional state, speaking of non-existent farm animals wandering around the kitchen table where my wife and I were seated. After apparently collapsing in my bedroom, I was taken to ER, which quickly determined that I was critically hypotensive (low blood pressure of 72/35). I quickly lapsed into cardiogenic shock, a condition where the heart all but stops pumping blood and one of the deadliest of all medical crises. Even among those who are still alive upon arrival at an ER,  70% to 80% die within hours or a few days. Those who survive likely do so, as I did, with kidneys in acute failure and brain damage similar to what is sustained by near-drowning victims who have been resuscitated by a lengthy CPR session.',\n",

Started with a 75 mg dose, immediately fell asleep for 4 hours, woke up feeling so out of it that I could barely string a sentence together, spent the next day feeling nauseous, hot, sweaty, jittery and weak. Got leg spasms that night and woke up 12 hours post-ingestion having a rebound panic attack. When morning finally arrived, I had the kind of hangover headache that you get when you're in college and have spent the night parting and binge drinking, but without any of the fun. The next day, upon advice from my psychiatrist, I dropped the dose right down to 25 mg, with no change in side effects. 3rd day I tried only 6.25 mg (quarter of a 25 mg pill), and still felt nauseous, hot, dizzy and weak...and fell asleep for two hours. This is now day 6 and I'm finally recovering from my 3 day trip to hell with Effexor. Left a 5 min message on my psychiatrist's machine - will not be taking this crap anymore!!
